# Free-Fall-Simulator

Simulates a free falling object that is dropped for three different models (vacuum, linear drag & quadratic drag)

Currently, I plan on using this for command line, but I may implement a GUI in the future. 

Future plans are:
1) Plot position v time, velocity v time and acceleration v time for each model
